     Table 20 is premium booth - worth the wait for larger party."
```

```
Staff: "Tell me about table 5's customer"
AI: "Sarah Johnson - VIP guest, 8 visits this year. 
     Allergic to shellfish, prefers window seats, 
     always orders wine pairing. Last visit: 5-star review."
```

**3. Operational Planning**
```
Staff: "How busy are we tonight?"
AI: "89 covers, peak 7-8 PM (28 covers). 
     Recommend 4 servers minimum. 
     3 tables need attention - seated 90+ minutes."
```
